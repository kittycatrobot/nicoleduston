The Truth of Growing Up 
 	
	I Know Why the Cage Bird Sings written by Maya Angelou, is a novel written from Maya’s perspective of growing up along with her brother in a town called Stamps where she found herself facing discrimination in her daily life. Farewell to Manzanar written by Jeanne Houston with the help of her husband, James D Houston, tells the story of when she was a young Japanese girl living in San Francisco, in 1941, and of growing up in the internment camps . Authors Houston and Angelou, through the usage of various literary devices, portray the struggles, hardships, and realizations that come with growing up and losing naiveness towards life. 
Through the use of imagery and analogies, Housten and Angelou were able to show show how in times of discrimination and hardships one's perspective on life can change as they come to an understanding of the situation. Angelou uses imagery to represent the struggles of segregation and how it is to grow up amidst these occurrences. “At fifteen life had taught me undeniably that surrender, in its place, was as honorable as resistance, especially if one has no choice” (Angelou 249). Angelou describes that when growing up, surrendering was equal to resistance, and even more so when one was limited. The use of the simile shows how Maya interprets the feeling, that the feeling of having to give up is equal to not giving in.. Maya Angelou uses imagery as a way to show a way to convey the pain in growing up and realizing the truth of how the world really is to the readers. “If growing up is painful for the Southern Black girl, being aware of her displacement is the rust on the razor that threatens the throat. It is an unnecessary insult” (Angelou 4). Angelou relates her experiences with racism and segregation to the violence of a razor to the throat. Angelou’s experince signifies that growing up and being exposed during these unprejudiced times was really like and how it truly impacted how they grew up.  In Farewell to Manzanar, the author uses analogy in order to disclose what the time spent at the camp meant for the future of a young girl’s life. “Papa’s life ended at Manzanar.… Until this trip, I had not been able to admit that my own life really began there” (Houston  122).  Highlighting the camp to be compared to a birth place, Jeanne used an analogy in order to compare what the camp acted for her in her life. 
Through the usage of both imagery and analogies, authors Houston and Angelou were able to convey what it is like growing up through discrimination and learning the truth about their surroundings. Angelou uses negative diction to describe the hardships that adult American Negro females faced, and how they are never given the respect they deserve. “The fact that the adult American Negro female emerges a formidable character is often met with amazement, distaste, and even belligerence. It is seldom accepted as an inevitable outcome of the struggle won by survivors and deserves respect if not enthusiastic acceptance” (Angelou 273). The author describes the actions of how prejudice and discrimination are futher impacted so for women of color and how when a woman starts to become formidable. THis emphasizes the author’s point that prejudice was there and kids had to grow up learning that these events occur and there was nothing they could do about it. In Farewell to Manzanar, author Jeanne Housten uses imagery to display how if someone was depicted as different they would be discriminated against, and sometimes might even be considered as invisible to others.  “ I smiled and sat down, suddenly aware of what being of Japanese ancestry was going to be like. I wouldn’t be faced with a physical attack or with overt shows of hatred, Rather, I would be seen as someone other than American, or perhaps not be seen at all” (Houston  142). Hoston describes how instead of being directly discriminated against she was ignored and she describes what it was like when she was invisible. This meant showing how she had grown to accept that she would sadly never be given the same treatment as others and she had to learn to just accept it and through accepting it she showed the loss of naivety that she once had to the world. In the same book, Jeanne Housten again uses imagery to describe how one views the hate that surrounds the world against them. “It was a bleak and awful sounding word, yet I had no idea what shape it might take if I confronted it, I saw it as a dark, amorphous cloud that would descend from above and enclose us forever” (Houston 136). Houston uses imagery to describe the word hate in her own words and of what she feared it was like, something that was dark and would be surrounded by forever. This indicates that she has come to an understanding that hate exists and she isn’t protected by the walls of a young child’s naiveness that one would usually have.  
Jeanne Houston and  Maya Angelou were both able to explain their personal stories about growing up in a timeline where they both were discriminated against for something out of their control, and how they were treated differently. Both authors emphasize the point of having to face some sort of difficulty regarding their ethnicity, and how it became more clear to them why the others were discriminating against them as they began to grow up. Jeanne Houston and Maya Angelou through the usage of many different literacy devices convey the message that hate, discrimination, and hardships that many have had  to endure forces many young kids to have to lose their innocence and naiveness towards the world they live in.
