Ms. Anna Smith, Store Manager
 Panda Express
10562 Mira Mesa Way
San Diego, CA 92128

Dear Ms. Smith,

I would like to apply for a position as a sales associate in your store.

I am prepared for this type of work because I have experience with  interacting with club members from clubs that I am leading, and I can follow directions quickly and accurately.  Panda Express is one of my favorite restaurants to go to so I have a vast understanding of the menu items and prices. In addition, I have and understanding of the discounts and advertising. I am hoping that I can use my skills to help your store. 

Currently, I am a senior at Westview High School, and I am seeking a part-time job that I can work throughout the remainder of high school, and during college.  I plan to attend college locally so I will be available for the next several years. I am available to work after school from 3:30 pm to 9 pm Monday through Friday.  I also have open availability on the weekends.  

You can reach me at (858) 442 4123 after 3:30 p.m. daily.  I am available to interview at your convenience.   I look forward to discussing possible present or future employment with your company.

Sincerely, 

Nicole Duston
